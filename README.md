stranger the korean drama is an amazing show. everything about it is amazing, it leaves you in suspense and makes you keep on guessing of who the killer is. the show keeps me on wit's end of who is the killer, but time and time my guesses were wrong until the show purposely reveals it. besides that, there is also another major villain, the one possibly behind the scenes of the entire play. but this is what i also like about the show, even though we know who the magician of the show is, the way that the main character is going to catch them red handed is another mystery. they're basically impossible to catch and the way that the main character will catch them by is yet another mystery. it's like trying to find the killers behind jeffrey epstein. besides the plot, the character development is amazing. the main character is slowly gaining his humane side back, episode by episode. overall 10/10 and better than any shows there is.
